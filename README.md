Ten Seconds Treasure Hunt
=========================

You are a pirate captain on a hunt for treasures!

Ten Seconds?
------------

Real-time pirate journeys are long and boring. Do you really want to sit days, weeks and months on a small nutshell within the sea, waiting for a small breeze? So, to speed things up, time is running faster and you have '''10 seconds''' to find the treasure!
